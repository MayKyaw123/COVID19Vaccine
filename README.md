# COVID19Vaccine
This project aims to construct a user guide for a specific dataset to assist researchers in accessing the data they need. The project stakeholders are the client, the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland, the project team, and the users of the open data source. The triumphant completion of the project will benefit the client by supplying them with a repository of documentation concerning the open-source data sets that researchers and students across the university can utilize. The project team will benefit from the experience of researching and analyzing open data sources, as well as the opportunity to generate data analysis examples. The users of the open data source will benefit from the increased accessibility of the data sets and the enhanced documentation of the datasets. The project will involve developing a coherent user guide, detailed essential information about the dataset, illustrating how to use the dataset, elaborating on the data analysis done using the dataset, and what the dataset shows for the users.

The deliverables consisted of a coherent user guide on COVID-19 vaccine datasets on DATA.GOV, explicit essential information regarding the dataset, clarifying how to operate the dataset, elaborating on the data analysis accomplished using the dataset, and what the dataset illustrates for the users. After researching information about the COVID-19 Vaccine Datasets on DATA.GOV, we assessed and surveyed the COVID-19 Vaccine-related datasets. This product displays a clear picture of the available dataset results as of March 04, 2023. The results contained a total of 144 datasets. The data collection process consisted of our team going through each of the datasets manually and verifying the fields such as Title of Dataset, Type of Dataset, Link, Government Level, Date Released, Date Updated, Vaccination SubGroup, and Agency. Our collection is available on an Excel fileÂ which is a cloud-based application that can be accessed and exported in various formats for the user's needs.
